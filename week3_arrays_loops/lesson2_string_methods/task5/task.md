Before we go forward, we should learn a new key word `null` in Java.

It is a possible value for reference types. There are two types of variable in Java:
* Primitives 
  * `byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean`
* Reference 
  * `String`
  * arrays
    * `int[], double[]...`
    * `String[]`
  * `Scanner`

`null` means no value. 

Note: `null` can be a default value in arrays
