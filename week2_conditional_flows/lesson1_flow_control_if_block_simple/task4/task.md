This is a task to help a driver to know the speed limits

Input: `int speed`

Depending on the `speed` we should inform a driver with different messages:

If `speed` is lower or equals 50 -> println `Best speed for driving in a city`
Otherwise, If `speed` is lower than 60 -> println `You are very close to getting a ticket`
Otherwise, If speed is greater 60 -> println `You are dangerous!`
Otherwise, println `speed is incorrect`
