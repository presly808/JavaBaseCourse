This is a task to help a driver to know speed limits

Input: `int speed`

Depending on the speed we should inform a driver with different messages:

If speed is lower or equal 50 -> println `Best speed for driving in a city`
Otherwise If speed is lower than 60 -> println `You are very close to get a ticket`
Otherwise If speed is greater 60 -> println `You are dangerous!`
Otherwise println `Speed is incorrect`

  Blocks must be connected with each other (if -> else if -> else if -> else)
