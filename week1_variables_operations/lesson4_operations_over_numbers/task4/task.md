My congratulations! It was challenging, was it not?!

We have already gone through **Arithmetical** operations. However, there are also **comparison**  operations.

* less `<`
  * types `byte, short, int, long, float, double`
  * `type < type -> boolean`
  * `5 < 7 -> true`
  * `5 < 2 -> false`
  * `5 < 5 -> false`
* less or equal `<=`
  * types `byte, short, int, long, float, double`
  * `type <= type -> boolean`
  * `5 <= 7 -> true`
  * `5 <= 2 -> false`
  * `5 <= 5 -> false`
* greater `>`
  * types `byte, short, int, long, float, double`
  * `type > type -> boolean`
  * `5 > 7 -> false`
  * `5 > 2 -> true`
  * `5 > 5 -> false`
* greater or equal `>=`
  * types `byte, short, int, long, float, double`
  * `type >= type -> boolean`
  * `5 >= 7 -> false`
  * `5 >= 2 -> true`
  * `5 >= 5 -> true`
* equal `==`
  * types `byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean`
  * `type == type -> boolean`
  * `5 == 7 -> false`
  * `5 == 5 -> true`
  * `true == true -> true`
  * `true == false -> false`
* not equal `!=`
  * types `byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean`
  * `type != type -> boolean`
  * `5 != 7 -> true`
  * `5 != 5 -> false`
  * `true != true -> false`
  * `true != false -> true`
