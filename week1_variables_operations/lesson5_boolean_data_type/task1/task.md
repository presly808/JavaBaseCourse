In this section, we will speak about `boolean` type and its operations.

You already knew about possible values of `boolean` : `true`, `false`

AND

its comparison operations `==`, `!=`

There are more operations over boolean such as:

* AND `&&`
  * `boolean && boolean = boolean`
  * `true && true -> true`
  * `true && false -> false`
* OR `||`
  * `boolean || boolean = boolean`
  * `true || true -> true`
  * `true || false -> true`
* NOT `!`
  * `!boolean = boolean`
  * `!true -> false`
  * `!false -> true`

The raw theory is not the key to success. We need more real-life examples
