**Summarization:**

You have already met the basic types:
* `int` for storing numbers without floating point ->  `1,-67,300,4,500` etc.
* `double` floating point numbers -> `23.5, 100.9, 999.999`
* `boolean` storing either `true` or `false`.
* `String` for some text -> `"Name","Sequence","4", "4.33"`
* (Notice that `"4"` is `String`, not `int`, and `"4.33"` also not `double`)

In the following lessons, we learn more about types, their operations, and conversions between types.
* We will teach you how to go from `String` to `int`, `double` to `int` etc
* Arithmetical, Logical, Comparison operations
* Boolean and its specifics

Also, try to meditate on different types of print to console
* `println`
* `print`
* `printf`
* String concatenation (`+` operator) as a powerful way to reduce the amount of code
